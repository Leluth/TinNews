# TinNews
A Tinder-like News App

The Instagram Flavor News app was designed based on Google Component Architectural MVVM Pattern. It implemented the bottom bar & page navigation using JetPack navigation component. And it utilized 3rd party CardStackView(RecyclerView) to support swipe gestures for liking/disliking the news. I also built the Room Database with LiveData & ViewModel to support local cache and offline model. Moreover, I integrated Retrofit and LiveData to pull the latest news data from a RESTFUL endpoint  (newsapi.org)
